PictureTheme is a program coded in Python 3 that gives any image a trichromatic theme (think the Obama "HOPE" poster).  The Myro module must be installed in order for this program to run properly.

Place the program file in a folder along with the JPEG file you wish to change.  Open the program with a Python 3 shell and run it.  Call the primary function with the JPEG file name as the argument (e.g. pictureTheme("ObamaHopePoster.jpg")).

The program will supply a list of themes that can be used on your image. Type a theme name in the dialog box provided and the new image will be displayed.  Choose whether or not you'd like to save the file.  If yes, you will be asked to enter a file name.  The .jpg file extension will be included, so you don't have to type it.
